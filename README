SOURCES

direct.cpp
	Solving the problem of the single phase isothermal flow transport [eq. 2.2.31, p.63]
	Al(x) dp(t,x)/dt - d(K(x) dp(t,x)/dx)/dx + D(x) p(t,x) = 0

tracer.cpp
	Solving the problem of the concentration of a passive admixture [eq. 3.2.1.2, p.91]
	dC(t,x)/dt - U(x) dC(t,x)/dx = q(t,x)
		where q(x) = -C(i | Pi(x) >= Pj(x), i != j / j) D(i,j)(x) (Pi(x) - Pj(x))

matrix.h
	Configuration file with matrixes K, D and left-right edge conditions

Additional files:

my libs:
solvers.cpp/solvers.h
	Realisation of numerical methods (progonka/Thomas method, simple implicit 2-nd order method)

vtk.cpp/vtk.h
	Functions for dumping data to files for paraview

simple_ODE.cpp
	Comparison with the accurate solution (K = 0)

compare.cpp
	Comparison with the accurate solution (D = 0)

parser.py
	Convert from data.vtk to plot.dat for gnuplot

dopicture.gnu
	Make picture with Gnuplot

meso.cpp (Needed to rewrite with armadillo) not worked now
	Old problem for the concentration of a passive admixture (was needed to compare with Ayrat)

HOWTO

make tracer or make direct
./tracer or ./direct
results will be in the res/
